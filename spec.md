# PigMusic: Musical Literacy Game for Children

## Overview
PigMusic is a whimsical, pig-themed web application designed to teach children the fundamentals of reading music through interactive gameplay. Built with TypeScript and React, the app combines educational content with engaging game mechanics to make learning music notation fun and accessible for beginners.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Children ages 5-10
- No prior music reading experience required
- Designed for self-guided learning with minimal adult supervision

## High-Level Objectives

### 1. Educational Goals
- Teach basic music notation literacy
- Build foundation for reading sheet music
- Develop pitch recognition skills
- Introduce rhythm and timing concepts
- Foster love for music through positive reinforcement

### 2. User Experience Goals
- Create an immediately engaging, colorful interface
- Provide clear, intuitive interactions suitable for children
- Maintain consistent pig-themed visual language
- Ensure accessibility for young learners
- Deliver instant feedback and rewards

### 3. Technical Goals
- Build a responsive, performant web application
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Implement smooth animations and transitions
- Create reusable, maintainable component architecture
- Support touch devices (tablets/phones)

## Mid-Level Objectives

### Core Game Mechanics

#### 1. Note Recognition Module
- **Musical Staff Display**: Show a clean, large treble clef staff
- **Random Note Generation**: Place notes on different lines/spaces
- **Interactive Piano**: Virtual keyboard for note selection
- **Pig Character Integration**: Animated pig mascot provides feedback
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with C, D, E, gradually add more notes

#### 2. Game Progression System
- **Level Structure**: 
  - Level 1: Middle C position (C, D, E)
  - Level 2: Add F and G
  - Level 3: Full C major scale
  - Level 4: Introduction to accidentals
- **Oink Rating System**: 1-3 oinks based on accuracy and speed
- **Unlock System**: New levels unlock after achieving minimum oinks

#### 3. Reward System
- **Pig Coins**: Virtual currency earned for correct answers
- **Pig Customization**: Unlock hats, accessories, backgrounds
- **Achievement Badges**: Special accomplishments (e.g., "Perfect Pitch Pig")
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing mastery

### Visual Design Requirements

#### 1. Pig Character Design
- **Main Mascot**: Friendly, animated pig teacher
- **Expressions**: Happy (correct), encouraging (incorrect), celebrating (level complete)
- **Animations**: Idle breathing, jumping, dancing, playing instruments
- **Customizable Elements**: Hats, bow ties, glasses, instruments

#### 2. Theme Elements
- **Color Palette**: Soft pinks, warm browns, pastel backgrounds
- **Background Scenes**: Barnyard, music room, concert stage
- **UI Elements**: Barn-door shaped buttons, hay bale progress bars
- **Sound Effects**: Pig snorts, oinks for feedback

## Low-Level Objectives

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Component Architecture
```typescript
// Core Components Structure
- App.tsx                    // Main application container
- GameEngine/
  - NoteDisplay.tsx         // Renders musical staff and notes
  - PianoKeyboard.tsx       // Interactive piano component
  - GameController.tsx      // Game logic and state management
- Character/
  - PigMascot.tsx          // Animated pig character
  - Customization.tsx      // Character customization interface
- UI/
  - LevelSelect.tsx        // Level selection screen
  - ProgressBar.tsx        // Visual progress indicators
  - RewardModal.tsx        // Reward/achievement popups
- Audio/
  - SoundManager.tsx       // Audio playback controller
  - NotePlayer.tsx         // Musical note synthesizer
```

#### 2. State Management
```typescript
interface GameState {
  currentLevel: number;
  currentNote: Note;
  score: number;
  strikes: number;
  pigCoins: number;
  unlockedItems: CustomizationItem[];
  achievements: Achievement[];
  settings: GameSettings;
}

interface Note {
  pitch: string;      // 'C4', 'D4', etc.
  staffPosition: number;
  accidental?: 'sharp' | 'flat';
}
```

#### 3. Game Flow Logic
- **Note Generation Algorithm**: Weighted random selection based on level
- **Timing System**: Configurable time limits per note
- **Scoring Algorithm**: 
  - Base points for correct answer
  - Speed bonus for quick responses
  - Streak multiplier for consecutive correct answers
- **Mistake Handling**: 
  - First mistake: Visual hint (highlight correct key)
  - Second mistake: Audio hint (play correct note)
  - Third mistake: Show answer, move to next note

#### 4. Audio Implementation
- **Web Audio API**: For low-latency note playback
- **Sound Assets**:
  - Piano samples for each note
  - Success/failure sound effects
  - Background music (optional, mutable)
  - Pig character voice clips
- **Audio Feedback**: Immediate playback on interaction

#### 5. Animation Requirements
- **React Spring**: For smooth UI transitions
- **Lottie/Rive**: For complex pig character animations
- **CSS Animations**: For simple UI feedback
- **Performance Target**: 60fps on mid-range devices

### Data Persistence
- **LocalStorage**: Save progress, settings, unlocked items
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline capability
- **Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface SaveData {
  userId: string;
  progress: LevelProgress[];
  inventory: CustomizationItem[];
  settings: UserSettings;
  statistics: GameStatistics;
}
```

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader**: ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- **Visual Adjustments**: High contrast mode option
- **Font Scaling**: Adjustable text size
- **Audio Alternatives**: Visual cues for all audio feedback

### Performance Targets
- **Initial Load**: < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Interaction Response**: < 100ms for user actions
- **Animation FPS**: Consistent 60fps
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB active memory
- **Bundle Size**: < 500KB initial JS bundle

## Future Expansion Possibilities
- Rhythm training modules
- Bass clef introduction
- Multiplayer challenges
- Parent/teacher dashboard
- Additional instruments beyond piano
- Music theory mini-games
- Compose your own melody feature

## Success Metrics
- Average session duration > 10 minutes
- Level completion rate > 80%
- Return user rate > 60%
- Positive feedback indicators (smiles, continued play)
- Measurable improvement in note recognition speed
